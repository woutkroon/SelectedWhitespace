# Whitespace Visualizer

Download this extension from the [Visual Studio Marketplace][marketplace] or get the [CI build][vsixgallery]

--------------------------------------

**See whitespace characters only when you need them.** This extension displays whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, and line endings) only within selected text, keeping your editor clean and clutter-free.

> Inspired by a community Visual Studio [feature request](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/t/Option-to-only-display-whitespace-charac/1516269). Go vote for it!

## Features

### Selection-Based Whitespace

Select any text to instantly reveal its whitespace characters:

![Selection Mode](art/selection-mode.png)

| Character | Symbol | Description             |
| --------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| Space     | `·`    | Middle dot              |
| Tab       | `→`    | Rightwards arrow        |
| CRLF      | `␍␊`   | Windows line ending     |
| LF        | `␊`    | Unix/macOS line ending  |
| CR        | `␍`    | Classic Mac line ending |

Line endings include tooltips explaining their type (e.g., "CRLF (Windows)").

### Extended View White Space Mode

When Visual Studio's built-in **View White Space** setting is enabled (Edit → Advanced → View White Space, or `Ctrl+R, Ctrl+W`), this extension enhances it by also displaying line endings throughout the document. VS normally only shows spaces and tabs.

### Smart Behavior

- **No duplication** - Selection whitespace is automatically disabled when View White Space is on
- **Outlining aware** - Whitespace inside collapsed code regions is hidden
- **Non-intrusive** - Uses subtle gray coloring that doesn't distract from your code

## How It Works

1. Select any text in the editor
2. Whitespace characters appear automatically within the selection
3. Clear the selection and they disappear

No commands, no configuration - it just works!

## Requirements

- Visual Studio 2022 (17.0 or later)
